✓ Better define how to layout a Module that has methods as well as sub-Modules
✓ Draw edges for included Modules as Interface
✓ Draw edges for ActiveRecord::Association
✓ Subclass edges
✓ Try to determine polymorphic relations
✓ Generate a command line interface for rumld
✓ Need to run the process against a rails project
✓ Need to switch on whether rumld is running against a rails project
- Refactor/rethink collection vs. render
- Convert to RSpec
- Check for referenced modules inside methods to infer additional relations
- Exception Nodes should appear differently
- Research ruby new gem

Bug?
- Check generator for like named constants in different module spaces (i.e. A::E & B::E)
